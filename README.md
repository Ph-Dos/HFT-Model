***What am I developing ?***
+ I want to make a performace critical program that detects asset price inefficiencies in `[ Secound, Minute ]` time intervals.
+ Real time alpha acquisition and processing system that can add bias to the detection system.
+ Mathmatical model that will be the foundtion of the detecion system. *( To the best of my ability )*
+ Real time asset price processing.
+ Embedded DL model that can enhance true asset price certainty. *( If possible )*
