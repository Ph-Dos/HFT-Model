## Overview

***What am I developing ?***
+ I want to make a performace critical program that detects asset price inefficiencies in `[ Secound, Minute ]` time intervals.
+ Real time alpha acquisition and processing system that can add bias to the detection system.
+ Mathmatical model that will be the foundtion of the detecion system. *( To the best of my ability )*
+ Real time asset price processing.
+ Embedded DL model that can enhance true asset price certainty. *( If possible )*

***What tools does this project use?***
+ WebSockets, for real time price collection.
+ Python, for high level program architecture.
+ Rust, for performance optimizations.
+ ==Statistical Arbitrage Model==
+ Deep Learning Model, mabey I can make a new variant that is speedy like Nivida NGP ðŸ§
