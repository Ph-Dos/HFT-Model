## Overview

***What am I developing ?***
+ I want to make a performace critical program that detect asset price inefficiencies in `[ Secound, Minute ]` time intervals.
+ A real time alpha acquisition and processing system that can add bias to detection system.
+ Mathmatical model *( To the best of my ability )* that will be the foundtion of the detecion system.
+ Real time asset price processing.
+ Embedded DL model that can enhance true asset price certainty. *( If possible )*
